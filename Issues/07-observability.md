# Task 07: OpenTelemetry Observability Implementation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive observability using OpenTelemetry with CloudWatch integration.

## Requirements
- Set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Implement distributed tracing for all services
- Add metrics collection and monitoring
- Configure CloudWatch export for logs and metrics

## Key Features
- Automatic instrumentation for HTTP requests and AI calls
- Custom spans for business logic (recipe detection, extraction)
- Performance metrics (response times, token usage, costs)
- Error tracking and alerting
- Request/response logging with correlation IDs

## Metrics to Track
- Request count and response times
- AI model usage and token consumption
- Error rates and types
- Web scraping success/failure rates
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- User interaction patterns

## Implementation Details
- Configure OpenTelemetry SDK with CloudWatch exporter
- Add custom instrumentation for Bedrock calls
- Implement correlation ID tracking across services
- Set up structured logging with JSON format
- Create dashboards and alerts in CloudWatch

## Deliverables
- [ ] OpenTelemetry SDK configuration
- [ ] Custom instrumentation for all services
- [ ] CloudWatch exporter setup
- [ ] Metrics collection implementation
- [ ] Structured logging configuration
- [ ] Dashboard and alerting setup
