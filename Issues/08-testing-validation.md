# Task 08: Testing and Validation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing and validation for all application components.

## Requirements
- Unit tests for all service classes
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Mock Bedrock responses for testing
- Validation of recipe detection accuracy

## Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual service functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing
- **Mock Tests**: Bedrock API simulation
- **Validation Tests**: Recipe detection accuracy
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and throughput

## Test Coverage Areas
- BedrockService connection and model calls
- WebScraperService URL fetching and parsing
- RecipeDetectorService classification and extraction
- RAGService Knowledge Base queries
- Streamlit interface functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

## Implementation Details
- Use pytest for test framework
- Create mock responses for external APIs
- Test with various recipe website formats
- Validate multi-language support
- Performance benchmarking for AI calls

## Test Data
- Sample recipe URLs for validation
- Non-recipe URLs for negative testing
- Multi-language content samples
- Edge cases and malformed inputs
