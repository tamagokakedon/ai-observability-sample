# Task 06: RAG System with Knowledge Base

## Overview
Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base for dish name queries.

## Requirements
- Create RAGService for Knowledge Base integration
- Support dish name queries against recipe PDFs in S3
- Implement document retrieval and answer generation
- Handle both recipe URL analysis and dish name queries

## Key Features
- AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base integration
- S3 bucket connection for PDF recipe storage
- Document embedding and similarity search
- Context-aware answer generation
- Fallback handling when recipes not found

## Implementation Details
- Use LangChain with BedrockKnowledgeBasesRetriever for Knowledge Base queries
- Integrate LangChain RetrievalQA chain for answer generation
- Implement vector similarity search through LangChain
- Add document chunking and retrieval optimization
- Include confidence scoring for retrieved documents
- Support for PDF recipe format: [Dish Name].pdf
- Use LangChain's Bedrock LLM integration for response generation

## Knowledge Base Setup
- Configure S3 bucket for recipe PDF storage
- Set up embedding model for document indexing
- Create retrieval configuration with LangChain
- Implement query optimization using LangChain chains
- Configure LangChain prompt templates for recipe queries

## Deliverables
- [ ] RAGService class implementation with LangChain
- [ ] Knowledge Base connection using LangChain retrievers
- [ ] Document retrieval functionality via LangChain
- [ ] Answer generation with LangChain QA chains
- [ ] S3 integration for PDF storage
- [ ] Fallback handling for missing recipes
- [ ] LangChain prompt template optimization
